# Reverse-Image-Search-Constructor
This project demonstrates image similarity search using two advanced techniques: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANNOY). This project uses the Caltech 101 dataset to extract features from images using the ResNet50 model, and then performs similarity searches to identify and visualize similar images.
